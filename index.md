# Data Scientist Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This repository contains some examples of the Data Science projects and code samples I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. 

## About Me

My name is Valentin Miguel Parra Carrascosa, I am a mechanical engineer, working as a data scientist in Paris in the energy business, with 5 years of experience in leveraging data to drive insights and make informed decisions: during 3 years as a Data Analyst, and the last 2 years as a Data Scientist. 
My expertise in data includes machine learning, data visualization, statistical analysis, deep learning (computer vision, natural language processing), and more. 
I have a background in the energy business, having worked since 2010 on multiple roles: rotating machines contracts technical manager, process engineer, tests engineer, and responsible for project design, for thermal and nuclear engineering business units.

## Projects

### Project 1: Prognosis (work in progress)

- **Description:** The objective of this project is to develop a robust prognostics model that predicts the remaining useful life (RUL) or failure probability of Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System based on engine degradation simulation data, obtained using the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS). The aim is to enable proactive maintenance strategies, reduce downtime, and optimize resource allocation.
- **Technologies Used:** Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox proportional hazards model. Used libraries: scikit-survival, lifelines, ProgPy 
- **GitHub Repository:** [Link to the GitHub repository.](https://github.com/valenparra/prognostics)
- **Demo/Documentation:** (work in progress)

More projects to come : 
- Plant species and diseases identification using leafs images
- Semantic search model: search engine to retrieve the most relevant documents when looking for a certain subject
